# Omega React Framework

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive React framework designed to facilitate the development of scalable and maintainable web applications. The framework incorporates various features and best practices to streamline development processes.

## Folder Structure
- `api/`: Contains modules for interacting with APIs.
- `components/`: Reusable UI components used across the application.
- `config/`: Configuration files for environment-specific settings.
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks to encapsulate logic and state management.
- `layouts/`: Layout components to structure the overall UI of pages.
- `middleware/`: Middleware utilities for handling cross-cutting concerns.
- `pages/`: Top-level components representing pages/routes of the application.
- `routes/`: Defines the routing configuration of the application.
- `store/`: Redux store configuration and slice reducers.
- `templates/`: Templates folder for Handlebars or other templating engine templates.
- `themes/`: Theme configurations and styles for consistent UI theming.
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions, including `newrelic.d.ts`.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helper modules.

## Features
- **Modular Structure**: Organized folder structure to enhance code readability and maintainability.
- **Redux Integration**: Utilizes Redux for centralized state management with predefined slice reducers.
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulates logic into reusable hooks for efficient state management and side effects.
- **API Integration**: Provides modules (`api/`) for interacting with external APIs.
- **Middleware Support**: Middleware layer (`middleware/`) for cross-cutting concerns such as logging and authentication.
- **Theming**: Allows easy customization of UI themes (`themes/`) for consistent branding.
- **Routing**: Configures application routing (`routes/`) to navigate between pages efficiently.
- **Handlebars Templates**: Supports templating with Handlebars (`templates/`) for server-side rendering or dynamic UI generation.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures TypeScript type definitions (`types/`) for seamless integration and reduced runtime errors.
- **Configuration**: Centralized configuration (`config/`) for managing environment-specific settings.

## Getting Started

### Installation
```bash

npm install

```

### Development

```bash

npm start

```
This command starts the development server and opens the application in your default browser.

### Production Build

```bash

npm run build

```

Generates a production build of the application in the build/ directory.
